## ▶️ How to Run These Files

Since these are `.class` files (compiled Java bytecode), you can run them using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) if you have the `.java` source code or use
the terminal like this:

```bash
java SimpleCalculator
java NumberOfSeries
java OddNumSeries
java MultiplesOfNum
````
